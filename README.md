Project: Task Management System
Overview:
The Task Management System allows users to create, update, delete, and view tasks. Users can register for an account, log in, and only access their tasks. The system also includes basic authentication and authorization functionalities.

1. Endpoints and Libraries:

Define Endpoints:

Create endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks:
GET /tasks - Get all tasks
POST /tasks - Create a new task
GET /tasks/:id - Get a specific task
PUT /tasks/:id - Update a task
DELETE /tasks/:id - Delete a task

Libraries:
Use Express.js for routing.
Use Mongoose for MongoDB connection and modeling.

2. Backend Architecture:

Routes:
Define routes for tasks in separate files under the routes folder.
Use Express Router to handle routing.

Controllers:
Create controller functions for handling requests related to tasks.
These functions will interact with services and send responses.

Services:
Implement service functions to encapsulate business logic.
Services will interact with the database through Mongoose models.

3. Authentication/Authorization:

User Authentication:
Implement user registration and login endpoints.
Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
Generate JWT tokens upon successful login.

Middleware:
Write middleware functions to verify JWT tokens for protected routes.
Middleware should be used to authorize every request and ensure only authenticated users can access certain routes.

4. Frontend Integration:

Integrate a react frontend with your backend application and make it full stack.

5. Deployment:

Configure CORS settings to allow frontend-backend communication.

Deploy your backend application on Render.
Deploy your frontend application on Vercel.

Connecting Frontend to Backend:
Update frontend code to use the correct URLs for backend endpoints.
Test frontend-backend communication to ensure data is being retrieved and updated correctly.

Additional Features:
User-specific tasks: Users can only access and manage their own tasks.
Error handling and validation for requests.
Pagination and filtering for tasks list.
